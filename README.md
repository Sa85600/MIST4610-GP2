## Dataset Description

Our dataset contains information about motor vehicle collisions in New York City. The dataset attributes consist of crash time, crash date, the borough the crash occured in, the contributing factor behind the crash, the latitude and longitude of the crash, the vehicle type code and the number of persons injured or killed in the crash. 

## Question 1: Are there more collisons involving buses during school start and end times in New York City?

Justification: This analysis allows us to determine if there are irregular spikes in collisions depending on the specified vehicle type. We created a line plot of collisions (y-axis) and time (x-axis). We differntiated the lines based on if the vehicle type involved in the crash was a bus or other.
